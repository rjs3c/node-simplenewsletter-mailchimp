    apiKey: "", // Note: API key can be found at https://<server>.admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/
    server: ""
});
```

* In **app.js**, you will also need to specify the ID corresponding to your created Audience. Information on how to create an Audience can be found [here](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-audience/), and information on how to find the Audience ID can be found [here](https://mailchimp.com/help/find-audience-id/)
```javascript
const run = async() => {
        const response = await mailchimp.lists.addListMember("", { // Note: Your audience ID goes here
            email_address: subscribingUser.email, // Structure: Email, First Name, Last Name. Please alter this if you require other fields.
            status: "subscribed",
            merge_fields: {
                FNAME: subscribingUser.firstName,
                LNAME: subscribingUser.lastName
